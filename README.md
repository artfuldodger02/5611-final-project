# 5611-final-project
 Interactive Game Based on Vampire Survivors

 ## To play the game, download all code and unzip the file "5611 final project.zip" for the executable

The base implementation of this project is based on and includes some code from Branno Taylors tutorial on creating a Vampire Survivors clone in Godot.
This tutorial was used as our group had little to no experience in godot, and required a example of how to implement features specific to this game type. 
This project includes a majority original features and unique implementations created soley by our group, but features such as leveling, attacking, and base enemy ai would not have been possible
without Branno Taylors tutorial series on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/@BrannoDev and his github project https://github.com/brannotaylor/SurvivorsClone_Complete
